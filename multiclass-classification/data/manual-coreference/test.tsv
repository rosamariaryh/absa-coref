SERVICE#GENERAL	as part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;
SERVICE#GENERAL	any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .
SERVICE#GENERAL	when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .
SERVICE#GENERAL	after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .
SERVICE#GENERAL	a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been `` blown off '' would be an understatement .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the manager continually interrupted with `` is there anything else i can do for you ? '' , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the manager promised to speak to a waitress , but we could hardly take the manager 's promise seriously , seeing as the manager had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .
SERVICE#GENERAL	in short , schooner or later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .

FOOD#QUALITY	on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .
FOOD#QUALITY	i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .
SERVICE#GENERAL	to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	in the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea ( i had water ) .

RESTAURANT#GENERAL	- i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray 's boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations .
LOCATION#GENERAL	ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .
LOCATION#GENERAL	imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third - best thing about ray 's !

SERVICE#GENERAL	to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

FOOD#QUALITY	i had a taste of all three items on her plate , and they were superb .
SERVICE#GENERAL	our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?

RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner ... they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	all considered , i have to say that ray 's boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution .
SERVICE#GENERAL	while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .
