FOOD#PRICES	i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .
SERVICE#GENERAL	at this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .
FOOD#QUALITY	so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	i could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the meat and spinach .
FOOD#QUALITY	so i decide to report back to the waitress because the $ 24 salmon was completely inedible .
SERVICE#GENERAL	guess what , i waited for twenty minutes before the waitress came over and when the waitress finally did , the waitress says , `` oh well , the waitress wish you would have said something earlier '' no apology , nothing .
SERVICE#GENERAL	after that the waitress simply took our plates , walked away , came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
SERVICE#GENERAL	no desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !
SERVICE#GENERAL	this is where it really really gets bad : the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .
SERVICE#GENERAL	again , no apology , no is there anything else the manager can get you , no can the manager get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !
SERVICE#GENERAL	the level of rudeness was preposterous .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .

SERVICE#GENERAL	fabulous food - if the front of house staff do n't put you off --
RESTAURANT#PRICES	it 's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions , but we 've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years .
SERVICE#GENERAL	each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .

SERVICE#GENERAL	the frizzy retro girl ( with winged / dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9 pm on a friday night because she `` had a bbq to go to '' that night - wtf ? ?
SERVICE#GENERAL	i 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
SERVICE#GENERAL	there 's another girl who i ca n't describe , she is about 5 ' 6 `` with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i 'm a friendly person , so i would n't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal .
SERVICE#GENERAL	again , i 'd be super upset if that were my employee .
SERVICE#GENERAL	considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service .

SERVICE#GENERAL	the food and service were fine , however the maitre - d was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant .
DRINKS#QUALITY	while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle of wine , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
SERVICE#GENERAL	this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the maitre - d 's response was smug , arrogant , and condescending , totally consistent with the maitre - d 's deportment on display all evening .
SERVICE#GENERAL	a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre - d 's sense of `` table turnover '' , as whacked as it is , or else .
SERVICE#GENERAL	if you go here , do it on the maitre - d 's off - night .
FOOD#QUALITY	best meal in a long time !

SERVICE#GENERAL	poor service and management
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	do n't go to this place !
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner .
SERVICE#GENERAL	appetizers took nearly an hour .
SERVICE#GENERAL	when the main course finally arrived ( another 45mins ) half of our order was missing .
SERVICE#GENERAL	never got an explanation as to what was going on .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
SERVICE#GENERAL	when we threatened to leave , we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing .
SERVICE#GENERAL	on the way out , we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues .
RESTAURANT#PRICES	ca n't believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to an expensive nyc restaurant 's clients .

SERVICE#GENERAL	so rude ! ! !
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that the hostess did not want to serve us .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said , `` can i help you '' and `` how many are in your party .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the three of us standing in front of the hostess should have been an indication of how many of us there were .
RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	we did n't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem .
SERVICE#GENERAL	shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non - existent customer service .
SERVICE#GENERAL	bad staff
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	i generally like this place .
FOOD#QUALITY	the food is good .
AMBIENCE#GENERAL	the design of the space is good .
SERVICE#GENERAL	but the service is horrid !
SERVICE#GENERAL	i was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .
SERVICE#GENERAL	the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !
SERVICE#GENERAL	the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .
SERVICE#GENERAL	i could n't ignore the fact that a waitress reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .
SERVICE#GENERAL	a waitress then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	i wish i could like this place more , and i wish someone would retrain the staff .
