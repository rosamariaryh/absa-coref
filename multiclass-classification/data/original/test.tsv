SERVICE#GENERAL	Even then, the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items.
SERVICE#GENERAL	We had a very hard time getting the waitress' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager.
SERVICE#GENERAL	As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20% discount on our bill.
SERVICE#GENERAL	When the bill came, he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks.

FOOD#QUALITY	Also love their caeser salad.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I don't like the servers, one young woman in particular.
SERVICE#GENERAL	She doesn't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance.
SERVICE#GENERAL	But she is very friendly with certain people, making it even more annoying.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners.
FOOD#QUALITY	Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service, so it can't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers.

SERVICE#GENERAL	None that I can think of.
SERVICE#GENERAL	We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers, the food didn't arrive until 45 minutes later...WITH OUR MAIN COURSE.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Um so now what are appetizers for???
SERVICE#GENERAL	Oh I forgot to mention that they don't have bread service.
SERVICE#GENERAL	My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water (she had a sore throat) and I guess that since it was only water, it wasn't a priority for them to actually bring it.
SERVICE#GENERAL	In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their 'service scale'.
FOOD#QUALITY	Food wise, its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isn't a fancy place.

SERVICE#GENERAL	While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.
SERVICE#GENERAL	As part of a small party of four, our food was dropped off without comment;
SERVICE#GENERAL	any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table.
SERVICE#GENERAL	When we finally were able to flag someone down, it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food, who was also not the same person who had taken our order.
SERVICE#GENERAL	After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.
SERVICE#GENERAL	"A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment--to say we had been ""blown off"" would be an understatement."
SERVICE#GENERAL	"The manager continually interrupted with ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"", a strange comment because she had hardly listened, let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience."
SERVICE#GENERAL	She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage, but we could hardly take her promise seriously, seeing as she hadn't bothered to get the waitresses name.
SERVICE#GENERAL	In short, Schooner or Later couldn't have cared less about our being at their establishment.
FOOD#QUALITY	you are with a hot date and he/she has an urge for sushi...then this might be the place.

FOOD#QUALITY	The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great, at least initially.
FOOD#QUALITY	The steak was done to my exact liking (medium rare) and was nice and juicy.
FOOD#QUALITY	It?s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction, though both were indistinguishable in taste.
FOOD#QUALITY	Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.
FOOD#QUALITY	My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ?MSG? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant.
FOOD#QUALITY	They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting; very light and not-too-sweet.
FOOD#QUALITY	The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner.

FOOD#QUALITY	I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.
SERVICE#GENERAL	To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).

RESTAURANT#GENERAL	– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.
LOCATION#GENERAL	Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.
LOCATION#GENERAL	Imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third-best thing about Ray's!

SERVICE#GENERAL	To start things off, our lovely server Brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order.
FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS	My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.

FOOD#QUALITY	For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.

FOOD#QUALITY	The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).

FOOD#QUALITY	My friend enjoyed the grilled Alaskan King Salmon with delectable creamed Washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans.
FOOD#QUALITY	I had a taste of all three items on her plate, and they were superb.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue:  Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?

RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner...they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	All considered, I have to say that Ray's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution.
SERVICE#GENERAL	While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us, our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one.
