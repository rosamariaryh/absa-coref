RESTAURANT#GENERAL	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Well...they can run but they can't hide.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	This place...god where do i begin.
AMBIENCE#GENERAL	It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!

RESTAURANT#GENERAL	How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
FOOD#QUALITY	Great Hot Dogs!
FOOD#QUALITY	Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.

FOOD#QUALITY	The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!

FOOD#PRICES	Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.

FOOD#QUALITY	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
SERVICE#GENERAL	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
RESTAURANT#PRICES	It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
SERVICE#GENERAL	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.

RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!

SERVICE#GENERAL	The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
SERVICE#GENERAL	"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"
SERVICE#GENERAL	I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
SERVICE#GENERAL	"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "
SERVICE#GENERAL	I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
SERVICE#GENERAL	Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
RESTAURANT#PRICES	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
SERVICE#GENERAL	So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
SERVICE#GENERAL	"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out"""
FOOD#QUALITY	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
SERVICE#GENERAL	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
DRINKS#QUALITY	While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
SERVICE#GENERAL	This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
SERVICE#GENERAL	His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
SERVICE#GENERAL	"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
SERVICE#GENERAL	If you go here, do it on his off-night.
FOOD#QUALITY	Best meal in a long time!
FOOD#QUALITY	Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
FOOD#QUALITY	I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
FOOD#QUALITY	My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Everyone must come here at least once.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Highly recommend it!
FOOD#QUALITY	Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
RESTAURANT#PRICES	At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.

AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Great Atmosphere
FOOD#QUALITY	I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.
AMBIENCE#GENERAL	Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Poor service and management
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Don’t go to this place!
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Appetizers took nearly an hour.
SERVICE#GENERAL	When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
SERVICE#GENERAL	The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
SERVICE#GENERAL	When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
SERVICE#GENERAL	On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
RESTAURANT#PRICES	Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.

RESTAURANT#GENERAL	What a hassle!
FOOD#QUALITY	The food is very good, but not outstanding.
SERVICE#GENERAL	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
FOOD#QUALITY	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
SERVICE#GENERAL	On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
RESTAURANT#PRICES	Expensive
FOOD#QUALITY	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.

SERVICE#GENERAL	So rude!!!
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
SERVICE#GENERAL	The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
SERVICE#GENERAL	The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
SERVICE#GENERAL	I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
SERVICE#GENERAL	"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
SERVICE#GENERAL	The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
SERVICE#GENERAL	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
SERVICE#GENERAL	bad staff
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I generally like this place.
FOOD#QUALITY	The food is good.
AMBIENCE#GENERAL	The design of the space is good.
SERVICE#GENERAL	But the service is HORRID!
SERVICE#GENERAL	I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
SERVICE#GENERAL	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
SERVICE#GENERAL	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
SERVICE#GENERAL	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
SERVICE#GENERAL	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
SERVICE#GENERAL	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
RESTAURANT#GENERAL	I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
